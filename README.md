Runs JSBSim to evaluate a given aircraft configuration. The configuration file is created with AeromatiC++, and post-processing uses pandas.
The configuration file is completed with data from AVL runs.

Developped on a macOS computer, but the code should be compatible with Windows, although not tested on this OS.
